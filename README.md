# enhancedcopypaste
Hold 10 items in your clipboard at once

Using our favorite key bindings command+c and command+v to access the Copy/Paste clipboard, this scripts "extends" the clipboards capability to hold 10 items. 
In reality, when we copy, we fetch the clipboard contents and put it into a list. Then, when we paste, we retrieve the content and load it back into the clipboard for pasting. 


Key Bindings: 
command + c + [0,9] (store into one of 10 cells) \n
command + v + [0,9] (retreive from one of 10 cells) \n
a+s (show contents of our clipboard) \n

Inspired by my friend Austin.
