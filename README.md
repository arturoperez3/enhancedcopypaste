# enhancedcopypaste
Hold 10 items in your clipboard at once.

Using our favorite key bindings command+c and command+v to access the Copy/Paste clipboard, this scripts "extends" the clipboards capability to hold 10 items. 

In reality, when we copy, we fetch the clipboard contents and put it into a list. Then, when we paste, we retrieve the content and load it back into the clipboard. 


Key Bindings: 

command + c + [0,9] (store into one of 10 cells)

command + v + [0,9] (retrieve from one of 10 cells)

a + s (show contents of our clipboard)

Inspired by my friend Austin.
